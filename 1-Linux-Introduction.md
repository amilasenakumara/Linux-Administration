# 🐧 Introduction to Linux – Complete Summary

## 📘 Overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn:
- What **Linux** is  
- Where it came from  
- What a **Linux distribution** (distro) is  
- Why Linux is preferred for certain applications and projects over other operating systems

## 🧩 What is Linux?

### 🖥️ Linux as an Operating System
- An **Operating System (OS)** is a collection of software that manages hardware resources and provides an environment where applications can run.
- It allows applications to:
  - Store and retrieve data  
  - Send documents to printers  
  - Interact with users  

### 💡 Linux as a Kernel
- The **kernel** is the **core of the OS**, managing communication between hardware and software.  
- It sits between:
  - Hardware ↔ Applications  
- To form a complete OS, the kernel combines with:
  - System libraries  
  - Graphical interfaces  
  - Utilities and tools (e.g., browsers, email, editors)

## 👨‍💻 Origin of Linux

- Created by **Linus Torvalds** in **1991** while studying Computer Science at the **University of Helsinki**.  
- Inspired by **Unix**, but written **from scratch**.  
- The first version, **Linux Kernel 1.0**, was released in **1994**.  
- Built as a **free, open-source** project.  

### 🧠 Why Linus Created Linux
- Linus wanted a Unix-like system for his PC, but commercial Unix systems cost around **$5,000**.
- He developed Linux to be a **free alternative** with similar power and flexibility.

## 🔓 Open Source Philosophy

- Linux is **Open Source Software (OSS)**.  
- This means anyone can:
  - Use  
  - Copy  
  - Study  
  - Modify  
  - Redistribute the code  

💬 As long as the **source code remains publicly available**.

- Thousands of developers have contributed to Linux’s evolution.  
- Some distributions are free; others charge for **compiled binaries** or **enterprise support** (e.g., Red Hat Enterprise Linux).

## 💿 Linux Distributions (Distros)

### 🧱 What is a Distro?
A **Linux Distribution** = Linux Kernel + Supporting Software + Package Management Tools + Optional GUI

Each distribution focuses on specific goals or audiences.

### 🏢 Types of Distributions
- **Commercial (Enterprise)**  
  - Backed by corporations  
  - Offer paid support  
  - Example: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

- **Community (Non-Commercial)**  
  - Maintained by volunteers  
  - Example: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, OpenSUSE  

### 🌐 Examples of Popular Distros
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**
- **Fedora**
- **CentOS**
- **AlmaLinux**
- **Rocky Linux**
- **Ubuntu**
- **Debian**
- **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)**
- **OpenSUSE**
