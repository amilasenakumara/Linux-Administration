## üß† Key Concepts and Terms
| Term | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| **Distro** | Short for ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù. |
| **Flavor** | Informal term for different versions of Linux. |
| **Kernel** | The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of Linux; the interface between hardware and applications. |

## üèóÔ∏è Linux Kernel Explained
- It‚Äôs the **intermediary** between software and hardware.
