# üêß Linux Command Navigation, PATH, and Help

## Introduction
In this lesson, you will learn how to:
- Navigate **man pages** üìñ
- Understand the **$PATH environment variable** üåê
- Use the **which** command to find command locations üîç
- Ask commands for **help** üÜò
- Search **man pages** efficiently üîé

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigating Man Pages

| Key | Action |
|-----|-------|
| Enter | Move down one line |
| Space | Move down one page |
| g | Go to the top of the page |
| G | Go to the bottom of the page |
| q | Quit the man page |

**Tip:** Learning man page navigation helps you explore commands directly in Linux.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

- **Definition:** Storage locations containing **name-value pairs**.  
- Usually **uppercase letters**.  
- View a variable with:

```bash
echo $VAR_NAME
```

- Example: `$PATH` is the most important environment variable for today.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ $PATH Environment Variable

- Controls the **command search path**.  
- Contains **colon-separated directories**:

```
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
```

- How it works:
  1. When a command is typed, Linux searches directories in `$PATH` **in order**.
  2. Executes the **first matching command** found.
  3. If not found, it returns `command not found`.

- Example to check your path:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Which Command

- Use `which` to **find the full path** of an executable:

```bash
which cat
which ls
```

- If multiple versions exist, the one **first in `$PATH`** is executed.

- Fun example:

```bash
which tac
```

- `tac` is `cat` in reverse: displays file contents **from bottom to top**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Asking Commands for Help

- Many commands provide help flags:

| Command | Help Options |
|---------|--------------|
| ls      | `--help`     |
| gzip    | `-h`, `--help` |

- Use help flags to get **usage hints** directly from the command.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Searching Man Pages

- Use `man -k SEARCH_TERM` to **search for commands** related to a term.  
- Example:

```bash
man -k calendar
```

- From the results, use `man COMMAND` to read the documentation.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Putting It Together

1. **Explore your `$PATH` directories**:

```bash
ls /bin
ls /usr/bin
```

2. **Use `which`** to find the location of commands:

```bash
which ls
```

3. **Try `--help` or `-h`** on commands for usage information:

```bash
ls --help
gzip -h
```

4. **Read the man page** for detailed documentation:

```bash
man ls
```

5. **Search man pages** if unsure which command to use:

```bash
man -k calendar
```
